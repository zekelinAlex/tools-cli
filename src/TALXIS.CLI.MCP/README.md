# TALXIS CLI MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for Power Platform and Dataverse development. Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Prerequisites

- [**.NET 10 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later

## Setup

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Add to `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TXC": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": ["TALXIS.CLI.MCP", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot Chat

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "TALXIS CLI": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "dnx",
            "args": ["TALXIS.CLI.MCP", "--yes"]
        }
    }
}
```

### Claude Code

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio txc -- dnx TALXIS.CLI.MCP --yes
```


No install needed — [`dnx`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-exec) downloads and runs the server on demand.

## Features

- **Tool Discovery & Execution** — Dynamically discovers and exposes all TALXIS CLI commands as MCP tools with typed input schemas
- **Task-Augmented Execution** — Long-running tools (deploy, import) support the MCP tasks protocol for async "call-now, fetch-later" execution with cancellation support
- **Structured Logging** — Streams real-time log output from CLI subprocesses to MCP clients via `notifications/message`
- **Progress Notifications** — Emits `notifications/progress` during long-running tool calls when the client provides a `progressToken`
- **Workspace Roots** — Requests the client's workspace roots via `roots/list` and uses the primary root as the subprocess working directory
- **Log Redaction** — Automatically redacts passwords, tokens, and filesystem paths from log output

## Developing and Debugging Locally

When developing the MCP server locally, you can run it directly from source and configure VS Code to use your local build. In your `.vscode/mcp.json`, set the server command to launch the project via `dotnet run`:

```json
{
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
        "TALXIS CLI Dev": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "dotnet",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--project",
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/TALXIS.CLI.MCP/TALXIS.CLI.MCP.csproj"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

- Adjust the path in `args` to match your local project location if needed.
- This setup allows you to test changes without reinstalling the global tool.

## Testing and Debugging

### Interactive Manual Testing

You can use the [Model Context Protocol Inspector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector) for interactive inspection:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run --project src/TALXIS.CLI.MCP
```

> **Note:** The Inspector is an interactive web browser application designed for manual testing and exploration. It is not suitable for automated testing scenarios.

### Command Line Debugging & Automated Testing

For debugging or automated testing, you can interact with the MCP server using JSON-RPC messages over stdin/stdout:

```sh
# Start the server
dotnet run --project src/TALXIS.CLI.MCP

# Then send JSON-RPC messages via stdin (one per line):
# 1. Initialize the connection (required by MCP protocol)
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2025-06-18", "capabilities": {}, "clientInfo": {"name": "test-client", "version": "1.0.0"}}}

# 2. List available tools
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}

# 3. Call a specific tool (example)
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "tool-name", "arguments": {}}}

# 4. Call a tool with progress tracking
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 4, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "environment_deploy", "arguments": {"Package": "MyPackage"}, "_meta": {"progressToken": "my-progress-1"}}}

# 5. Call a long-running tool as a task (returns immediately with task ID)
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 5, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "environment_deploy", "arguments": {"Package": "MyPackage"}, "task": {}}}

# 6. Poll task status
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 6, "method": "tasks/get", "params": {"taskId": "<task-id-from-step-5>"}}

# 7. Get task result (blocks until complete)
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 7, "method": "tasks/result", "params": {"taskId": "<task-id-from-step-5>"}}
```


#### Example JSON-RPC Messages

To list available tools:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}
```

To call a tool (replace arguments as needed):

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "workspace_component_create", "arguments": {"ShortName": "pp-entity", "name": "TestEntity", "Param": ["EntityType=InvalidType"]}}}
```

## Auth contract (stdio)

**The MCP server never runs an interactive auth flow.** Every `txc` tool
subprocess spawned by this server is forced headless — stdout is reserved
for JSON-RPC frames and the child has stdin/stdout redirected, so a
browser/device-code/masked-prompt attempt would either hang the session
or corrupt the transport. `CliSubprocessRunner` sets
`TXC_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` unconditionally on every spawn.

Prerequisites, before invoking any tool that touches a Dataverse
environment (or any other Connection-bound tool):

1. On the human's machine, run `txc config auth login` (interactive
   browser) or `txc config auth add-service-principal` once to register
   a credential and prime the MSAL token cache.
2. Run `txc config connection create <name> --provider dataverse ...`
   to register the endpoint.
3. Run `txc config profile create <name> --auth <alias> --connection <name>`
   to bind them, then `txc config profile select <name>` (or pin the
   workspace via `txc config profile pin`).

After that, MCP tool calls resolve the active profile silently via the
acquired token cache or stored SPN secret. If resolution fails (expired
refresh token, missing credential, broken config), the subprocess exits
non-zero and the MCP server surfaces the error through the tool-call
result; the structured log line includes the fail-fast remedy string
(`txc config profile validate <name>`).

### Per-call profile override

Any Connection-touching MCP tool accepts an optional `profile` argument
which is forwarded to the child as `--profile <name>`. This lets a
single MCP session switch between profiles per call without restarting
the server — e.g. an agent can target `customer-a-dev` for one tool and
`customer-b-prod` for the next.

### Client env allow-list (`mcpServers.<name>.env`)

The MCP server inherits the client's environment and the child CLI
subprocess inherits that. The following are meaningful to `txc`; anything
else is ignored:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TXC_PROFILE` | Select active profile for every call in this MCP session (overridden by per-call `profile` argument when supplied). |
| `TXC_CONFIG_DIR` | Override entire config directory (total CI isolation). |
| `TXC_NON_INTERACTIVE` | Redundant here — MCP already forces this to `1`. |
| `TXC_LOG_FORMAT` | Redundant here — MCP already forces `json`. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Service-principal fallback for CI / headless runners. |
| `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` | Kubernetes / Azure workload-identity federation. |
| `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`, `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` | GitHub Actions OIDC federation. |
| `TXC_ADO_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`, `TXC_ADO_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` | Azure DevOps pipelines workload-identity federation (legacy `PAC_ADO_*` also honored). |

Secrets (client secrets, PATs, certificate passwords) are **never**
accepted as plain MCP tool arguments — they are stored in the OS-level
secret vault via `txc config auth add-service-principal` and referenced
from config by `SecretRef` handle only.

### Log redaction

`McpLogForwarder` runs every child stderr JSON log line through
`LogRedactionFilter` before emitting `notifications/message` to the MCP
client. Patterns covered: `Bearer <token>`, `Authorization:` headers,
bare JWTs, connection-string secret keys (`Password`, `ClientSecret`,
`AccessToken`, `RefreshToken`, etc.) and URL query-param secrets
(`code=`, `token=`, `access_token=`). This is the last-chance belt for
accidental `logger.LogError(ex, ...)` leaks where the Dataverse or
Microsoft.Identity SDKs embed tokens inside exception messages.

### Forbidden patterns (forward-compat for HTTP transport)

When the HTTP/SSE transport ships, `txc-mcp` will be an **OAuth resource
server only** — Entra ID remains the authorization server. The following
patterns are forbidden by the MCP spec and will not be implemented:

- **Token passthrough**: never forward a client's bearer token directly
  to Dataverse — always use on-behalf-of or a separate service account.
- **Tokens in URIs**: never embed access tokens in query strings.
- **Non-HTTPS redirects** (except loopback for local dev).
- **Missing PKCE**: all OAuth flows must use PKCE.
- **Missing audience check**: tokens must be audience-bound to the
  `txc-mcp` resource URI (RFC 8707).

See `docs/mcp-http-auth-notes.md` (design notes, no code in v1).

## MCP vs. direct CLI fallback

Agents configured with both `txc-mcp` and the `txc` CLI on PATH may
sometimes invoke `txc` directly in the terminal instead of going
through MCP — for example when the server failed to start, when a
tool hasn't been discovered yet via progressive disclosure, or after
a transient runtime error. This is supported (the CLI is the source
of truth), but it changes what auth, logging, and progress look like.

See [docs/mcp-fallback.md](../../docs/mcp-fallback.md) for the
behaviour matrix, platform-specific notes, and how to make terminal
fallback behave like MCP by setting `TXC_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` and
`TXC_LOG_FORMAT=json` in the agent shell.

## Progressive Disclosure Architecture

### The Problem

MCP clients like GitHub Copilot have practical limits on the number of tools they can handle effectively. With 128+ CLI commands registered as MCP tools, the full catalog causes context bloat — the client's LLM spends tokens parsing tool schemas instead of reasoning about the user's task.

### The Solution

`txc-mcp` uses **progressive disclosure** to expose only a small set of always-on tools at startup, then dynamically injects additional tools as needed:

**Always-on tools (9 total):**
- **6 guide tools** — `guide`, `guide_workspace`, `guide_environment`, `guide_deployment`, `guide_data`, `guide_config` — domain-scoped tool discovery via LLM sampling
- **`execute_operation`** — bridges same-turn execution for tools discovered by a guide
- **`get_skill_details`** — retrieves public developer-facing skills (documentation, best practices)
- **`copilot-instructions`** — manages `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for AI assistants

### The Workflow

1. **Guide call** — The client calls a guide tool (e.g., `guide_workspace`) with a natural language query describing the task.
2. **Sampling** — The guide sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client's LLM with the full internal catalog, asking it to select the most relevant tools. Internal reasoning skills are injected for domain-specific expertise.
3. **Same-turn execution** — The guide returns structured results with tool names and schemas. The client can immediately call `execute_operation` with the selected tool name and arguments — no round-trip needed.
4. **Direct calls (next turn)** — Matched tools are injected into the `ActiveToolSet`. Clients discover injected tools by re-fetching tools/list on subsequent turns, and can then call them directly by name.

### Skills Architecture

`txc-mcp` has a two-tier skills system:

- **Internal skills** (proprietary) — Embedded `.md` files in `Skills/Internal/` containing Power Platform development expertise, decision trees, and workflow patterns. These are loaded by `GuideReasoningEngine` and injected into sampling prompts. They are **never exposed to clients** — they guide the server's own reasoning.
- **Public skills** (developer-facing) — Loaded from `TALXIS.CLI.Features.Docs` embedded resources. Accessible via the `get_skill_details` MCP tool and the `txc docs` CLI command. These contain documentation, best practices, and how-to guides for developers.

### Local-First Development Philosophy

Guide tools and internal skills encode a **local-first** philosophy: prefer local workspace operations (scaffolding, validation, schema inspection) over live environment operations (API calls to Dataverse). Environment operations take 30 seconds to 5 minutes and should only be used for inspection, troubleshooting, or deployment after local validation is complete.
