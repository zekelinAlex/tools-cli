# Deployment Workflow

## The Full Pipeline

```
local dev → build → pack → import → publish → verify
```

Each step has specific `txc` tools and checkpoints.

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Local Development
Use `workspace_component_create` to scaffold components. Edit XML files. Write plugin code. All local, all in source control.

### 2. Build
Build the solution project locally to catch errors early — malformed XML, missing references, schema violations.

### 3. Pack
```
Tool: environment_solution_pack
```
Creates a `.zip` solution file from your local project. This is still a local operation — no environment interaction yet.

### 4. Import
```
Tool: environment_solution_import
```
Uploads the solution package to the target Dataverse environment. By default returns immediately with an `asyncOperationId`. **Do NOT use `--wait`** — solution imports take minutes and will time out the MCP request. Instead, monitor progress with `environment_deployment_get --async-operation-id <id>` (the id is printed by `environment_solution_import`) until status is `Completed` or `Failed`. Never query the `asyncoperation` table directly via SQL — `deployment_get` parses the findings for you.

### 5. Publish
```
Tool: environment_solution_publish
```
Publishes all customizations. Without this step, changes to forms, views, and other UI components won't be visible to users.

### 6. Verify
```
Tool: environment_deployment_get --latest
```
Check the deployment status and review any findings (warnings, errors, informational messages).

## Build Configuration: Managed vs Unmanaged

The build configuration you pack/publish with decides whether the package contains **managed** or **unmanaged** solutions, and getting it wrong is a common deployment failure.

| Config | Solutions | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `Debug` (`dotnet build`, `dotnet publish -c Debug`) | **unmanaged** | dev/test environments that already hold unmanaged solutions |
| `Release` (`dotnet publish -c Release`) | **managed** | staging/production |

**You cannot overwrite an unmanaged solution with a managed one (or vice versa).** A `-c Release` package imported over an existing unmanaged solution fails with:

> You can't overwrite an unmanaged version of this solution with a managed version.

When deploying, first check what's already there:
1. Are the existing solutions on the environment managed or unmanaged? (`environment_solution_uninstall-check` / inspect the environment)
2. Build with the matching configuration.
3. On a mismatch, either uninstall the existing solution and re-import, or rebuild with the correct configuration.

## Pre-Flight Checks

Before deploying, validate:

| Check | Tool |
|---|---|
| Auth/connection is valid | `config_profile_validate` |
| Connected to correct environment | `config_profile_get` |
| Solution can be safely updated/removed | `environment_solution_uninstall-check` |

## Changeset Workflow

For environments that support staged deployments:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `environment_changeset_status` | Check current changeset state |
| `environment_changeset_apply` | Commit staged changes |
| `environment_changeset_discard` | Rollback staged changes |

Changesets let you group multiple imports and verify before committing.

## Troubleshooting Deployments

If import fails:
1. `environment_deployment_get --latest` — check error findings (or `--async-operation-id <id>` from the import output)
2. `environment_component_layer_list` — look for conflicting layers
3. `environment_component_dependency_required` — find missing dependencies
4. Fix locally, rebuild, and retry

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't skip the local build step — XML errors are much faster to catch locally than at import time
- ❌ Don't deploy unmanaged solutions to production — use managed for proper versioning and clean uninstall
- ❌ Don't skip `environment_solution_publish` after import — UI changes (forms, views) remain invisible without it
- ❌ Don't retry a failed import without first checking `environment_deployment_get --latest` — you'll repeat the same error
